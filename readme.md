This is a WeThinkCode_ first year web project where I had to create a website for sharing images.
You can take images using your device's camera or upload images straight from your local storage.
You can also add stickers and frames to your images.

NOTE: These were my early days of PHP and web dev, so most of the code here does not follow the best practices.
It safe to say that everything here is glued together. Have fun looking at this nightmare.
