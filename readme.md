## Description
This is a WeThinkCode_ first year web project where I had to create a website for sharing images.
You can take images using your device's camera or upload images straight from your local storage.
You can also add stickers and frames to your images.

## Requirements to run
1. Download and install Bitnami WAMP from https://bitnami.com/stack/wamp/installer
2. Download and install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads

## Running the project
1. Start Bitnami manager.
2. Clone the repository into the HTDOCS folder Bitnami.
   You will find the HTDOCS folder in the following path if you installed in on your C drive.
   C:\Bitnami\wampstack-7.3.20-0\apache2\htdocs
3. Then go to http://localhost/camagru/setup.php to initialise the database.
4. Go to http://localhost/camagru/ and navigate the website as you would with any other website.
